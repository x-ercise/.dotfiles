# Azure Functions for Visual Studio Code (Preview)

[![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) [![Installs](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs-short/ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions)

Create, debug, manage, and deploy Azure Functions directly from VS Code. Check
out this [deployment tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/functions-extension/getting-started)
to get started with the Azure Functions extension.

## Prerequisites

Follow the OS-specific instructions to install the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local):

* [Windows](#windows)
* [Mac](#mac) (Homebrew)
* [Linux](#linux) (Ubuntu/Debian)

Install the prerequisites for your desired language:

* [JavaScript](#javascript)
* [C#](#c)
* [Java](#java)
* [Python (Preview)](#python)

> **NOTE**: You may change your `azureFunctions.projectLanguage` user setting to multiple other 'preview' languages not listed above. This allows you to create a project/function in that language, but we do not yet support local debugging for these languages.

## Features

* Create new Function projects
* Create new Functions from a template
* Debug Function projects locally
* Deploy to Azure Function Apps
* View, create, delete, start, stop, and restart Azure Function Apps
* View, edit, upload, and download application settings
* JSON Intellisense for `function.json`, `host.json`, and `proxies.json`
* Stream logs from your remote Function Apps
* Debug Java Function App on Azure (experimental)
    > **NOTE**: To enable it, you can set `azureFunctions.enableRemoteDebugging` to true.

## OS-Specific Prerequisites

> **NOTE**: npm can be used on all platforms. On unix platforms, you may need to specify `--unsafe-perm` if you are running npm with sudo. That's due to npm behavior of post install script.

### Windows

Both v1 and v2 of the runtime can be installed on Windows. [See here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions) for more information on each version.

To install v1:

```bash
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools
```

To install v2:

```bash
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@core
```

**IMPORTANT**: v2 is becoming generally available (GA) soon (as of 9/19/2018). After GA, the commands will change to the following:

To install v1:

```bash
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@v1
```

To install v2:

```bash
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools
```

### Mac

```bash
brew tap azure/functions
brew install azure-functions-core-tools
```

### Linux

1. Set up package feed
    * Ubuntu 18.04

        ```bash
        wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
        sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
        ```

    * Ubuntu 17.10

        ```bash
        wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/17.10/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
        sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
        ```

    * Ubuntu 16.04 / Linux Mint 18

        ```bash
        wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
        sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
        ```

1. Install

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install azure-functions-core-tools
    ```

See [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/blob/master/README.md) for more installation options and the latest instructions.

## Language-Specific Prerequisites

### JavaScript

* [Node 8.0+](https://nodejs.org/)

### C#

* [VS Code Debugger for C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
* [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x)

> **NOTE**: The default experience for C# uses class libraries (&ast;.cs files), which provide superior performance, scalability, and versatility over C# Scripts (&ast;.csx files). If you want to use C# Scripts, you may change your `azureFunctions.projectLanguage` user setting to `C#Script`.

### Java

* [VS Code Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)
* [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Maven 3.0+](https://maven.apache.org/)
  > **NOTE**: Once Maven is downloaded, you must ensure that Maven is in your PATH environment variable. You can check this by running: `mvn -v`.

### Python

* [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* To enable project creation and debugging, set `azureFunctions.enablePython` to true. **IMPORTANT**: Python support in Azure is still in private preview.

## Managing Azure Subscriptions

If you are not signed in to Azure, you will see a "Sign in to Azure..." link. Alternatively, you can select "View->Command Palette" in the VS Code menu, and search for "Azure: Sign In".

![Sign in to Azure](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions/raw/master/resources/SignIn.gif)

If you don't have an Azure Account, you can sign up for one today for free and receive $200 in credits by selecting "Create a Free Azure Account..." or selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Create an Account".

You may sign out of Azure by selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Sign Out".

To select which subscriptions show up in the extension's explorer, click on the "Select Subscriptions..." button on any subscription node (indicated by a "filter" icon when you hover over it), or select "View->Command Palette" and search for "Azure: Select Subscriptions". Note that this selection affects all VS Code extensions that support the [Azure Account and Sign-In](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-account) extension.
