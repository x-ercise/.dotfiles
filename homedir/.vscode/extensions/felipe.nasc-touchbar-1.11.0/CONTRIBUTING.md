Hey, thanks for contributing! :)

These are some guide lines to help you out.

### Adding buttons

When adding buttons, try to ensure these steps:

- Create the button/feature (use default false, to avoid braking existing layouts)
- Try and use ASCII characteres for the button icon, if possible.
- Create the settings entry for the button (use default _false_)
- Add the feature and option to the documentation (readme.md)
- Open a Pull Request at [https://github.com/NascHQ/nasc-vscode-mac-touchbar](https://github.com/NascHQ/nasc-vscode-mac-touchbar)
