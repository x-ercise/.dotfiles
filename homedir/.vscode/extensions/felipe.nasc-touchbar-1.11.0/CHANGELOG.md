# Change Log
All notable changes to the "nasc-touchbar" extension will be documented in this file.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
Important, if the buttons don't fit in the bar, they will not be shown (this is a current bug in VSCode support for the TouchBar and soon to be fixed).  
If the bar disappeared, see the options (ctrl+, or cmd+,), filter by "nasc" and adjust the settings.

Usually, if your are not using the "Strip" group of buttons, you can fit **9** buttons on it. If you have the OS's _Strip_ buttons enabled, you can fit **6** buttons.
