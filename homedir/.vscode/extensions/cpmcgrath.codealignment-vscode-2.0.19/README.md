# Code Alignment for Visual Studio Code
Port of the C# Code base to TypeScript

Code alignment is the practice of formatting your code vertically to improve readability.

Based on principles borrowed from mathematics and other disciplines, code alignment gives extra meaning to your code by lining up similar data in columns. This is something we do naturally when working with tables and spreadsheets, but unfortunately it doesn't get applied to code often enough.

The usual excuses are, "It's too hard. It takes too long. They don't pay me enough." With this extension, these excuses are no longer valid.

##Current State
Many of Code alignment's best features are currently missing. The plan is to release early and release often, and to eventually reach parity.

## How to use
To use:
