Once an invited "guest" joins, you'll get a notification, and will see their cursor appear in your currently opened file. All guests will start out <a id="follow-guest-link1" href="https://aka.ms/vsls-docs/vscode#following">"following"</a> you, which means that as you scroll or navigate between files, they will track those actions as well. This makes it easy to orient them with the issue/question/task you're about to start collaborating on.</p>
